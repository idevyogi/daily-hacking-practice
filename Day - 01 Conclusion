🗓️ Day XX - [16 July 2025] | Daily Learning Update
🔥 Key Focus: Python Basics for Beginners + GitHub Practice Logs
✅ What I did today
📘 Python Day 1 Completed

Started from absolute basics of Python.

Created a new file in my Python Journey repository to organize learnings.

Covered:

What is a variable in Python?

How to declare and assign values to variables.

Naming conventions and good practices.

Printing values and using type() to check data types.


🗂️ GitHub Documentation Practice

Maintained today's learning log in my repository.

Learned how to add images and format markdown in README properly.


🔍 Realization from Today’s Flow

Writing everything to GitHub is helping me track micro learnings.

Meri biggest learning yeh thi ki notes aur actions jab ikattha likhta hu, tab mujhe pata chalta hai main actually kis jagah stuck hua tha.

Yeh system mujhe discipline aur motivation dono de raha hai.

💡 Today's Reflection
"Cybersecurity is not just about tools — it's about daily research, documenting learnings, and knowing exactly where you stand in your journey."
